# GCP Cloud Run Project Structure

This project contains multiple GCP Cloud Run services, each organized in its own directory. Each service directory follows a consistent structure to maintain organization and best practices.

## Directory Structure

Each Cloud Run service directory should contain:

- `src/` - Source code for the service
- `Dockerfile` - Container definition for the service
- `cloudbuild.yaml` - Cloud Build configuration
- `README.md` - Service-specific documentation
- `requirements.txt` or `package.json` - Dependencies
- `.env.example` - Example environment variables

## Best Practices

1. Each service should be self-contained and independently deployable
2. Use environment variables for configuration
3. Include proper logging and monitoring
4. Follow security best practices
5. Include proper documentation

## Deployment

Each service can be deployed independently using Cloud Run. The deployment process is automated through Cloud Build using the `cloudbuild.yaml` configuration.

## Common Patterns

- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement health checks
- Set up proper IAM roles and permissions
- Configure appropriate resource limits
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new directory for each service
2. Follow the standard directory structure
3. Implement the service logic
4. Test locally using Docker
5. Deploy to Cloud Run using Cloud Build
